# Various-Methods-for-Solving-ODES-and-finding-Polynomial-Roots
MATLAB code from university. This compared Euler's Method, Heun's Method and Crank Nicolson Methods to solve various ODEs

assignment2.pdf contains the questions we were given and Assig2 Ans are my answers, written up, which includes the code I used in assignemnt2.m

assignemnt2.m has the code used for each question followed by the functions used to solv ODEs and roots by various methods. This includes Backwards-Euler, Crank-Nicolson and Heun's method. Added to this are Newton which finds polynomial roots via the Raphson-Newton method, evolve which is a further way to numerically solve an equation and EOCs which caclualates teh Experimental Order of Convergence.
